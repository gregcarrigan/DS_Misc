We know all of the possible outcomes of rolling the die, but we do not know ahead of time which outcome will occur. These types of events are referred to as **random events, random experiments, or random variables**. Probabilities are assigned to the possible outcomes of these random variables. \n",

    "### The Three Axioms of Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Axiom 1: Nonnegativity**\n",
    "\n",
    "For any event $A$, the probability of the event must be greater than or equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ 0 \\le P(A) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, probabilities must be non-negative, real numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Axiom 2: Unit measure**\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of the entire sample space is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ P(S) = 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "From this axiom we define that the probability of all possible events, the sample space, must be equal to 1. This is sort of like saying the probability that _anything_ happens is 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Axiom 3: Additivity**\n",
    "\n",
    "For mutually exclusive, or in other words \"disjoint\" events $E$, the probability of any of the events occuring is equivalent to the sum of their probabilties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ P\\left(\\cup_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\; E_i \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} P(E_i) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we have two events: \"cloudy\" and \"sunny\" that define outcomes for the weather for tomorrow. These events are mutually exclusive. If it is cloudy it necessarily cannot be sunny, and vice versa. To get the probability of _either_ of these events occuring we can sum their probabilities."

    "From the axioms outlined above, a variety of essential properties of probability can be derived. Many of these are outlined below.\n",

    "**The probability of no event**\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of the empty set, denoted $\\emptyset$, is zero.\n",

    "### $$ P\\left(\\emptyset \\right) = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**The probability of A or B occuring (union)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of event $A$ or event $B$ occuring is equivalent to the sum of their individual probabilities minus the intersection of their probabilities (the probability they both occur).\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of an event conditional on another event is written using a vertical bar between the two events. The probability of event $A$ occuring _given_ event $B$ occurs is calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} $$\n",
    "\n",

    "**Joint probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "The joint probability of two events $A$ and $B$ is a reformulation of the above equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B) \\; P(B) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Verbally, if we want to know the probability that both $A$ and $B$ happen, we can multiply the probability that $B$ happens by the probability that $A$ happens given $B$ happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The law of total probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say we want to know the probability of the event $B$ occuring across _all_ different events $A$. For example, lets say that we are a judge presiding over a murder trial. $B$ is the event that the suspect's wallet was found at the scene of the murder. We could have many hypotheses or possible scenarios in which the wallet is found at the murder scene, one of which being that the suspect was actually at the scene of the crime at the time of the murder.\n",
    "\n",
    "These different events $A$, our scenarios, are disjoint. The _total probability_ of $B$ is the probability across all of these scenarios that the wallet is found at the murder scene. So in other words - regardless of which possible scenario $A$ - what is the probability overall that the wallet is at the murder scene?\n",
